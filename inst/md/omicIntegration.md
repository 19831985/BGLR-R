The following scripts illustrate how to fit some of the models presented in [Vazquez et al., Genetics (2016)]().

#### Installing required libraries

The code below illustrates how to install BGLR and BGData from GitHub. BGLR can also be installed from CRAN using `install.packages()`.

```R
 install.packages(pkg='devtools',repos='https://cran.r-project.org/')    #1# install devtools
 library(devtools)                                                       #2# load the library
 install_git('https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR/')                            #3# install BGLR from GitHub
 install_git('https://github.com/quantgen/BGData/')                      #4# install BGLR from GitHub
```   

#### Loading the data and libraries
